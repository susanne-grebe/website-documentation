## Introduction

The pages you create are linked in a sitemap, they are not added to any menu. Only the existing pages are added to the menu's in the header or footer.

Pages can be used to display a single service or add important information. Each page is build up out of a few sections.

The page itself has 2 important sections, 1 is the seo part and 2 the hero part.
Then to each page you can add [page sections](/articles/Page/page-section/) `as many as you want` the options for this are explained in the page section documentation. 

At the end of each page you have the option to add a call to action, this call to action will link to your contact page.
