## Description

Netlify is the host of your website, the website is build with the ReactJs framework, this is a JavaScript framework.

Browsers like 'Safari, Chrome, firefox' need files from the server in HTML format in order to understand what it needs to show to the user.

The moment something is published on Contentful, a webhook is triggered telling netlify that the  content on the website needs to be updated.

Netlify then downloads all the files from github, it looks for a build instructions file. Once  netlify found these instructions it starts converting all the JavaScript into HTML code and  stores those HTML files in data-centers.

This way your website is stored on multiple locations, if a user from berlin clicks on a link to your website netlify see the location of that user. 

It then sends the files to the users browser from the clostest location.
