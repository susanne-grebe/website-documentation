## Introduction

This is the part where you update your local seo content. 

Every section has a number in front of the section title that corresponds to the number in the image. 

After the title there is a little description for each field with suggestions, these don't have to be followed but are highly recommened.

## 1: SEO Url

This is the url to your website. The canonical URL is set to `https://www.susanne-grebe.de` this tells google that this is the original url.

As long as you don't change from domain this field should not be updated.

## 20: Publish Changes

Whenever you made any changes you always need to publish these. The moment you publish the changes your site is rebuild by netlify and the cache updated.

If you don't see any changes you might want to hit `shift cmd r` on Mac and `shift alt r` on windows with the browser open.

It will trigger a hard reload of the page and clears your browser cache for that particular website.
