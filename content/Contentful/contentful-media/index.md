## Renaming Title & Description

The title and description are both 2 important fields as they are being used for people with disabilities and for SEO purposes. 
You increase the possibility to rank for certain keywords in both search and images search.

__Note:__ Make sure both languages are selected. See [languages](#languages) for more details

![title & description](./title-description-assets.png)

### 1: Title

The title of the images is a short description of what you see on the image. It's common practise to use your keywords in the title you want to rank for. 
Say for example you want to rank for `coaching in Aachen` the title could be ```Susanne Grebe is coaching five people in Aachen```.

__Note:__ Creating titles this way you increase your chances of people finding your website over image search.

### 2: Description

Here you can add a bit more information plus some extra keywords.

Let's take the example rom above:

```
Susanne Grebe is coaching five people in Aachen to find a better 
balance between work and there private life.
```

This way your image might rank for ```coaching in aachen``` but also for ```find a better balance between work and private```.
