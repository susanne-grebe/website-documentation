## What is Contentful?

Contentful is content infrastructure. Their platform lets you create, manage and distribute content to any platform. 

Unlike a CMS, contentful gives you total freedom to create your own content model so you can decide which content you want to manage. They provide you RESTful APIs so you can deliver your content across multiple channels such as websites, mobile apps (iOS, Android and Windows Phone) or any other platform you can imagine (from Google Glass to infinity). 

With an uncluttered user interface, Contentful is an efficient tool for creating and managing your content online, either alone or in team. 

Assign custom roles and permissions to team members, add validations depending on the kind of content you have to insert and add media such as images, documents, sounds or video.

## What is the difference between Contentful and a CMS?

The problem with content management systems (CMS) is that they are created around one type of content theyâ€™re optimized to display, which is usually a website. Most CMSs became simple web publishing tools instead of general content management systems. They offer pre-existing content models that narrow the possibilities and are very coupled to one presentation layer.

Contentful, on the other hand, has a three-step process. 

First of all, you define a content model which is independent from any presentation layer that defines what kind of content you want to manage. 

In a second step, you and other internal or external editors can manage all of the content in our easy-to-use and interactive editing interface. 

Last but not least, contentful serve the content in a presentation-independent way, and you can take the content and create engaging experiences around it. Contentful is therefore completely adapted to your needs.

__Here are some of the features that make Contentful special:__
